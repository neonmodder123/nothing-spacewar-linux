Welcome to a dualboot project with Ubuntu Touch and Android for the Nothing Phone 1 (Spacewar)
This tree is deeply based on Fairphone 5 (fp5) on Ubports Gitlab reference port (halium 11)
# WARNING:
This project is very experimental and is very dangerous and might risk hard-bricking your phone! Your data may and may not be wiped. Proceed with caution.
You also should boot android **at least once**!!!
# Guide to dualboot:

1. Download the latest release of Ubuntu Touch

2. Extract the .zip file

3. Reboot your device into fastboot mode

4. Unlock the bootloader (if you haven't already)

5. Flash the boot and vendor_boot images and reboot to recovery using these commands:
```
fastboot set_active b
fastboot flash boot_b boot.img
fastboot flash vendor_boot_b vendor_boot.img
fastboot reboot recovery
```
6. Push the bin folder:
```
adb push bin/ /tmp/
```
7. Run the parted commands in adb shell:
```
adb shell
cd /tmp/bin
chmod +x *
./parted /dev/block/sda
unit GB
print
```
7. Note down the End value and partition number of the partition userdata (should be 10).

8. Run the following parted commands below.
```
mkpart ubtouch_data
```
9. Note down that the START_GB is END_GB subtracted by the amount you want to give in GB to Ubuntu Touch. ex. END_GB - 64 = START_GB). Set the file system type to ext4, and type the START_GB that you calculated into "Start?" and the END_GB in "End?" then run this parted command to confirm that you created the partition successfully:
```
print
quit
```
   It should show you a new partition with the number 11 called ubtouch_data.

10. In the UBPorts recovery, click **Advanced** , then click **Reboot to recovery**.

11. Use the mkfs.ext4 binary to format your new partition:
```
./mkfs.ext4 /dev/block/sda11
```
12. Mount your new partition to /data and exit the adb device shell:
```
mount /data
exit
```
13. Push the ubuntu.img rootfs to /data using adb:
```
adb push <drag ubuntu.img> /data/
```
14. Reboot!

  You have now successfully dualbooted Android and Ubuntu Touch! Wait 2-4 minutes for the first boot. You should see the Ubuntu Touch bootanimationand see    the setup. Proceed to the next step.

15. Finish the Ubuntu Touch setup and connect to the internet if you did not already.
16. Open the Open Store and search for an app called "Switch my Slot" and install it.
17. Now if you want to switch back to android, open the newly installed app and click Switch Slot, and reboot!
You can also switch slots in android using the app [Boot Control](https://github.com/capntrips/BootControl/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha03), but you need to have root installed. If you do not want to root your device, you will manually have to reboot to fastboot mode/bootloader and use fastboot on your PC to switch to Ubuntu Touch.

# _**IMPORTANT NOTE**_: You can NEVER, lock the bootloader in this state. EVER! If you attempt to, you will risk hard-bricking your phone! (Black screen, not turning on at all.) Although this is recoverable with EDL Mode, it is not recommended to lock the bootloader.
